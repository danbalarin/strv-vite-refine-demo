# React CRA

The simplest React app built using Create React App with Jest as test runner.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create new project: `yarn create react-app . --template typescript`
2. Add React testing library for hooks: `yarn add -D @testing-library/react-hooks`
3. For UI your only option is to use `majestic` library, that can't be installed as part of project, so you have to install it globally or use `npx`
4. App is ready to use and test!
